TODO:
  - add detection of win states using the 4 blue and 4 red board representations
  - add init board with rocks
  - create abstraction for a board-piecetype pairing that keeps track of its own 4 rotations
    - so that I don't have to type "red" "blue" and "rock" so many times
  - Create an abstraction that handles coordinate calculations/lookups for indexing into each board-piecetype, so that each board-piecetype doesn't have to redo them.
    - Would be created and passed to each board-piecetype in `set`
        Indexer {
          plain: Coord,
          invert: Coord,
          diag: Coord,
          diag_rotate: Coord,
        }
