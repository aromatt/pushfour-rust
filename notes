       $ rustc -L ../rust-minimax/target/debug/ --crate-type=lib -g -o board src/board.rs
       $ objdump -d board
    - Cut down on unnecessary copying of memory
    - Maybe allocate all memory ahead of time
    - Do some profiling
    - use u32 instead of u64?
  - CODE CLEAN UP
    - add init board with random rocks
    - create abstraction for a board-piecetype pairing that keeps track of its
      own 4 rotations
      - so that I don't have to type "red" "blue" and "rock" so many times
    - Create an abstraction that handles coordinate calculations/lookups for
      indexing into each board-piecetype, so that each board-piecetype doesn't
      have to redo them.
      - Would be created and passed to each board-piecetype in `set`
          Indexer {
            plain: Coord,
            invert: Coord,
            diag: Coord,
            diag_rotate: Coord,
          }
